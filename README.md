## General info
Having somewhere to write down ideas, thoughts, reflections, or just rambling nonsense allows someone to compartmentalise what's on their mind or get something off their chest and I want to provide that. Firebase will firstly provide authentication to ensure the user's privacy and then all journal entries are held on a database supplied by Firebase.

## Features
* Authentication: to ensure that only the user and whoever they wish can see the entries
* Secure storage: should a device ever be lost or broken and an entry needs to be pulled back up, not a problem. All entries are held by Firebase and can be found again if the user uses the same credentials

## Future Features
* Somewhere for the user to upload a picture or possibly even a gif. to add a bit of flair to their entry

## Inspiration
Diaries seem a little dated now and a bit too easy to be accessed so this seems like a nice alternative. I also recently found out what a "finsta" is and what purpose is serves and I want this to be a lean into that. 

I've also been meaning to get into writing down my own thoughts, etc. for my own benefit.
