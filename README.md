## General info
Journalling has been something that I've been meaning to get into to for a while. Not for the sense of any public acknowledgment but purely for my own benefit - to have somewhere to reflect upon previous experiences or issues.

## Features
* Somewhere to throw down a journal entry with no text limit
* Secure sign in to ensure that all entries are secure and only visible to the user and anyone they wish to share their credentials with

## Inspiration
Seems like a healthy way of compartmentalising everything. Not everyone has someone to talk to or share stuff with or be willing to do so
